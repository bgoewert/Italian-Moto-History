            <section>
                <p>Aprilia was founded after the Second World War as a bicycle production factory in Noale, a town
                    located in Venice. Alberto's son, Ivano Beggio, took over the helm of the company in 1968 and
                    constructed a 50cc moped with a dozen or so collaborators. The first production Aprilia mopeds were
                    named Colibrì, Daniela and Packi.</p>

                <p>Later, in 1970, they produced a motocross bike called the Scarabeo. Produced until the end of the
                    1970s, the Scarabeo came in 50cc and 125cc versions. In 1977, Ivan Alborghetti from Milan won the
                    Italian 125cc and 250cc motorcross championships on Aprilias. Alborghetti closed the 1978 season
                    with two third places in individual races and sixth place in the World Championship.</p>

                <p>In the 1980s Aprilia added an enduro, trials and road bikes between 50cc and 600cc. In 1981, Aprilia
                    introduced the TL 320 trials machine. In 1983, Aprilia launched the ST 125 road bike and in 1984
                    added an improved model called the STX. Also added in 1984 was an enduro called the ET 50.</p>

                <p>In 1985, Aprilia started outsourcing engines for some models to the Austrian company Rotax. That same year, Aprilia launched the STX 125 and STX 350. In 1986, they launched the AF1; a small sports model, and the Tuareg; a large tanked enduro for African rallies, particularly the Paris-Dakar Rally <sup><a href="#cite-1">[1]</a></sup>. Aprilia factory rider Philippe Berlatier contended for the trials world championship reaching fifth place, and Loris Reggiani rode an Aprilia GP 250 with Rotax engine to sixth place in the road racing World Championship. Two seasons later, on August 30, 1987, at the San Marino Grand Prix in Misano, Loris Reggiani's AF1 won the first World Speed Championship. Then in 1990, Aprilia launched a road bike derived from off-road mechanics named Pegaso 600.</p>

                <p>Later, in 1992, Aprilia rider Alessandro Gramigni won the World 125 Road Racing Championship title. Tommy Ahvala won the World Trials Championship on an Aprilia Climber that same year. Since then, Aprilia has won the 125cc and 250cc class Grand Prix a combined 124 times as well as 15 Road Racing World Championship titles and 16 European speed titles. Many world champions started on an Aprilia, such as Biaggi, Capirossi, Gramigni, Locatelli, Sakata, and Rossi.</p>
                
                <p>Starting in 1990, Aprilia entered the scooter market with Italy's first all-plastic scooter, the Amico. In 1992, Aprilia introduced the Amico LK and the two stroke Pegaso 125. Both with catalytic converters. In 1993 Aprilia launched a large diameter wheel scooter, reusing the name Scarabeo, with a four-stroke, four-valve engine. Later Aprilia launched more scooters such as the Leonardo, the SR, and the Gulliver.</p>

                <p>In 1995, Aprilia commissioned Philippe Starck to design the Motò which was shown in New York's Modern Art Museum. Also in 1995 Aprilia launched the two stroke RS 125 and RS 250 sports bikes.</p>

                <p>Finally, in the late 90s, the 1000cc motorcycle class was becoming popular with the introduction of more lightweight materials. In 1998, Aprilia released their version known as the RSV Mille and Falco. The former was a superbike and the latter a sport tourer with an emphasis on sport. Both bikes used a variation of a Rotax 1000cc V-Twin engine. And in the following year, Aprilia entered World Superbike Championship racing with its RSV Mille.</p>

                <p>During 2000, Aprilia acquired <a href="moto_guzzi.html">Moto Guzzi</a> and Laverda, both historic heritage Italian marques. That same year, Aprilia launched the 50 cc DiTech (Direct Injection Technology) two stroke engine for scooters, which provided high mileage and low emissions. Also released was the RST Futura, a sport tourer, and the ETV 1000 Caponord, an adventure touring motorcycle. Both of these latter two motorcycles used a variation of the Rotax 1000cc V-Twin.</p>

                <p>In 2003, Aprilia launched the RSV Mille Tuono, which was essentially an RSV Mille with traditional handlebars, not of the clip-on style, and only a small headlight fairing, to give it the appearance of a standard motorcycle. Most of the major motorcycle magazines picked it for the best bike of the year.</p>
                
                <p>The following year, in 2004, Aprilia was acquired by Piaggio & C. SpA, to form the world's fourth largest motorcycle group at the time, with 1.5 billion Euro in sales, an annual production capacity of over 600,000 vehicles, and a presence in 50 countries. The acquisition by Piaggio introduced the newly nominated President of Aprilia, Roberto Colaninno, and the Managing Director, Rocco Sabelli. And son of the founder, Ivano Beggio, was given the title of Honorary President.</p>
                
                <p>On 15 August 2010, Aprilia became the most successful motorcycle racing brand in history, surpassing fellow Italian <a href="mv_agusta.html">MV Agusta</a>, with a record 276th GP victory <sup><a href="cite-2">[2]</a></sup>.
