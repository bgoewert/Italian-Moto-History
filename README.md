# Website: Italian Moto History

## STLCC IS 139 Final Project

### Purpose and Goals

The main purpose of this site is to display, and hopefully educate visitors on, the rich history of Italian motorcycles. Another goal would be to provide a directory or map of locations and events to experience these motorcycles up close.

There does not seem to be one site dedicated to the love of Italian motorcycles. And, outside of Wikipedia or actually physically visiting a museum or a related event, there is not one website where you can learn the entire history of these Italian machines. This site will hopefully fill both of these areas.

While there have been a lot of [Italian motorcycle manufacturers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_motorcycle_manufacturers#Italy) throughout history, for the purpose of this project, this site is going to focus on the main players in the North American market. In the future, the site may be expanded to include more, if not all, of the other manufacturers.

### Intended Audience

Motorcycle enthusiasts, historians, and the casual inquisitor interested in learning about motorcycles.

### Required Content

Logos of each manufacturer, and pictures of different motorcycles produced by that manufacturer over the years. Videos of what these machines looked like being operated and hopefully audio of what they sounded like going down the road. And finally, paragraphs describing their history and relevance to the motorcycle world.

In addition to those obvious requirements, the site will also need events and locations in order to provide a visitors a directory to see theses motorcycles up close. Events may include past, current, and future races, exhibitions, or other notable dates. And the locations may primarily include museums as they are educational by nature, as well as Manufacturer related locations like a headquarters or historical building. There should also be a form on each such page that allows a visitor to submit an item to be included in the directory.

### Wireframe

For multiple reasons, I did not have a desktop program readily available to easily create a wireframe. So, I signed up and verified for an [education license of Figma](https://www.figma.com/education/), which allowed me to create wireframes from a browser and easily share them.
