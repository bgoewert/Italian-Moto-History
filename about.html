            <p>Originally built by <a href="https://bgoewert.com" target="_blank">Brennan Goewert</a> on a small HTC smartphone during slow night shifts in 2016 in order to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Re-made as a final project for IS 139 "Web Publishing" at St. Louis Community College. Project wise, this site incorporates several different elements that fulfil requirements for the final.</p>
            <p><a href="https://github.com/bgoewert/Italian-Moto-History" target="_blank">View the project repository on GitHub.</a></p>
            <p>The main purpose of this site is to display, and hopefully educate visitors on, the rich history of Italian motorcycles as well as provide a directory for events and museum locations where visitors can find where to experience these Italian machines for themselves.</p>
            <p>There does not seem to be one site dedicated to the love of Italian motorcycles, that I am aware of. And, outside of Wikipedia or actually physically visiting a museum or a related event, there is not one website where you can learn the entire history of these machines. This site will hopefully fill both of these areas.</p>
            <p>While there have been a lot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_motorcycle_manufacturers#Italy" target="_blank">Italian motorcycle manufacturers</a> throughout history, for the purpose of this project, this site is going to focus on the main players in the North American market. In the future, the site may be expanded to include more, if not all, of the other manufacturers.</p>
