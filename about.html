            <p>The main purpose of this site is to display, and hopefully educate visitors on, the rich history of Italian motorcycles. Another goal would be to provide a directory or map of locations and events to experience these motorcycles up close.</p>
            <p>There does not seem to be one site dedicated to the love of Italian motorcycles. And, outside of Wikipedia or actually physically visiting a museum or a related event, there is not one website where you can learn the entire history of these Italian machines. This site will hopefully fill both of these areas.</p>
            <p>While there have been a lot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_motorcycle_manufacturers#Italy" target="_blank">Italian motorcycle manufacturers</a> throughout history, for the purpose of this project, this site is going to focus on the main players in the North American market. In the future, the site may be expanded to include more, if not all, of the other manufacturers.</p>
