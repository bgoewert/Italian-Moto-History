            <p>Learn about the history of Italian two wheeled transportaion.</p>
            <p>Italians have always been a leader in art and design. The name that first comes to mind that emphasizes the art
                and design of Italian history is Leonardo Da Vinci. During his time he was technologically ahead of the rest
                of the world. From the 19th century to today Italy has been one of the leaders in automotive and motorcycle
                design. Companies like Lamborghini, Ferrari, Ducati, and Vespa are a few examples of this. Their beautiful
                designs of four and two-wheeled vehicles are a testament to the craftsmanship they can achieve. However,
                this is not about what auto and Moto designs Italians can create. It's about the two-wheeled machines they
                have already manufactured.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first of these creations was by a bicycle maker named Eduardo Bianchi. Bianchi made Italy's first motorcycle when he
                attached a motor to one of his pedal powered bicycles in the late 1800's. From there he delve into other
                areas of manufacturing including airplanes, cars and other various things. Several other companies followed
                suit in making motor powered bicycles after Bianchi's invention to supply the rising demand.
